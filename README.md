# IOT-Based-Weather-Station
The cost-effective weather station proposed
in here is a new practical approach for monitoring
the weather conditions at a particular place and sharing
the meteorological data anywhere across the globe. The
main feature of the proposed work is the inclusion of Air
Quality Index monitoring, it also sends the information to
the cloud server. The technology behind this is the Internet
of Things (IoT), which is an advanced and efficient solution
for connecting things to the internet and connecting the
entire world of things in a network.
